# school-extensions
is a collection of "science" scripts to investigate interesting scenarios and problems posed throughout my gradschool experience. Most of the collected scripts were originally created to tackle a project from coursework; all of the scripts, however, were modified for self-motivated deeper exploration into the topic.
Each item in this repository comes with the standard "science" code warning. **Nothing** here was created for any of the following purposes: legibility, portability, reproducability, safety, or ease of deployment. In physics, scripts are laregly a **means to an end**, so view and test this code at your own risk.
